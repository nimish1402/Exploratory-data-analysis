# Exploratory-data-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization methods . EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it helps analysts gain insights into the data, formulate hypotheses, and inform the choice of appropriate statistical methods for more in-depth analysis.
It basically involves:
**1 Univarient Analysis:-** Univariate analysis involves the examination and interpretation of a single variable in isolation. It focuses on understanding the distribution, central tendency, and dispersion of a single variable without considering its relationship with other variables. The primary goal of univariate analysis is to summarize and describe the characteristics of a single variable.
**2 Bivarient Analysis and Multivarient Analysis:-** Bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis are two stages of statistical analysis that involve the examination of relationships between variables, but they differ in the number of variables considered.while bivariate analysis focuses on the relationship between two variables, multivariate analysis extends the analysis to three or more variables, providing a more nuanced understanding of complex relationships in a dataset. Both stages are essential in the overall data analysis process and are often used sequentially in conjunction with univariate analysis.
